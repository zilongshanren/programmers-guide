# Chapter 2: Basic Cocos2d-x Concepts

Cocos2d-x is a game engine based upon OpenGL. It provides a simplified API for developing cross platform mobile and desktop games. By encapsulating the power inside and easy to use API, you can focus on developing your games and worry less about the implementation of the technical underpinnings.

Cocos2d-x provides `Scenes` and `Scene Transitions`, `Sprite` creation, `Menus`, `3D`, `Audio` and so much more. Everything you need to create your games is included.

## Main Components
At the heart of Cocos2d-x are `Scenes`, `Nodes`, `Sprites`, `Menus` and `Actions`. Look at any of your favorite games and you will see all of these components!

Have you played this very popular game?

Can you see any of these components? Let's make sure:

Taking this one step further lets break it down to see the `Layers` involved in making up this scene.

![](2/layer_annotated_scaled.png "")

The `Scene` on the left is actually made up of multiple `Layers` that are given a different `z-order` to make them "stack" on top of each other. `Layers` are simply `Nodes`.

This is only an intro scene, lets have a look at actual game play:

As you can see it takes a lot of pieces that need to fit and work together. 

## Scene Graph
A `Scene Graph` is a data structure that arranges a graphical scene. A `Scene Graph` contains `Nodes` in a tree structure.

![](2/tree.jpg "Simple Tree")

Since the `Scene Graph` is a tree; you can walk the tree. Cocos2d'x uses the `in-order walk` algorithm. An `in-order walk` is the left side of the tree being walked, then the root node, then the right side of the tree. Since the right side of the tree is rendered last it is displayed first on the `Scene Graph`

The `Scene Graph` is easily demonstrated, lets take a look at one of the figures above broken down:

Would be rendered as a tree, simpliedfied to the following:

## Director
Cocos2d-x uses the concept of a `Director`. Yes, just like in a movie! The `Director` makes decisions and tells the necessary recipient what to do. One common `Director` task is to control `Scene` replacements and transitions. The `Director` is a shared singleton object that you can call from anywhere in your code. It also takes care of the OpenGL initialization process.

Here is an example of a typical game flow. The `Director` takes care of transitioning through this as your game criteria decides:

## Sprites
Sprites are key in every game. Writing a platformer, you probably have a main character that is made by using an image of some sort. This is a `Sprite`. Taking another look at an image from above:

![](2/2_annotated_scaled_sprites.png "")

`Sprites` are objects that have properties and can have `Actions` run upon them.

```cpp
auto mySprite = cocos2d::Sprite::create("mysprite.png");

MySprite->setPosition(cocos2d::Vec2(300, 400));

mySprite->setRotation(40);

mySprite->setScale(1.5); // sets scale X and Y uniformly
```

## Actions
Another integral part of Cocos2d-x is `Actions`. `Actions` allow the transformation of `Nodes` in time space. Want to move a `Sprite` from one `Point` to another and use a callback when complete? No problem! You can even create a `Sequence` of `Actions` to be performed on a `Node`. You can change `Node` properties like position, rotation and scale. Example Actions: `MoveBy`, `Rotate`, `Scale`. All games use `Actions`

Taking another look, here are `Actions` in work.

![](2/2_actions_scaled.png "")

Actions are easy to create:
```cpp
auto myNode = cocos2d::Node::create();

// Move a sprite 50 pixels to the right, and 10 pixels to the top over 2 seconds.
auto moveBy = cocos2d::MoveBy::create(2, cocos2d::Point(50,10));
myNode->runAction(moveBy);

// Move a sprite to a specic location over 2 seconds.
auto moveTo = cocos2d::MoveTo::create(2, cocos2d::Point(50,10));
myNode->runAction(moveTo);
```

## Sequences
Just like it sounds, a `Sequence` is multiple `Actions` run in a specified order. Need to run the `Sequence` in reverse, no problem. Cocos2d-x handles this with no additional work.

An example `Sequence` for moving a `Sprite` gradually:

![](2/2_sequence_scaled.png "")

This `Sequence` is easy to make:

```cpp
auto MyNode = cocos2d::Node::create()

auto moveTo1 = cocos2d::MoveTo::create(2, cocos2d::Point(50,10));
auto moveBy1 = cocos2d::MoveTo::create(2, cocos2d::Point(100,10));
auto moveTo2 = cocos2d::MoveTo::create(2, cocos2d::Point(150,10));
auto delay = cocos2d::DelayTime::create(1);

MyNode->runAction(cocos2d::Sequence::create(moveTo1, delay, moveBy1, delay, moveTo2, NULL));
```
## Parent Child Relationship
Cocos2d-x uses a `Parent and Child` relationship. This means that properties and changes to the parent node are applied to its children. Consider a single `Sprite` and then a `Sprite` that has children:

![](2/2_parent_sprites_scaled.png "") 

With children, changing the `Scale` of the parent will also change the `Scale` to all children.

![](2/2_parent_sprites_scaledXY_scaled.png "")
```cpp
auto myNode = cocos2d::Node::create();

// scaling by setting
myNode->setScale(1.5); // scales uniformly by 1.5
```

Just like with `Scale`, if you `Rotate` the parent the children will also get rotated.

![](2/2_parent_sprite_rotate_scaled.png "")
```cpp
auto myNode = cocos2d::Node::create();

// rotating by setting
myNode->setRotation(50);
```

## Audio
Every game needs music and sounds. Cocos2d-x provides an easy to use `Audio` API.


## What Else Does Cocos2d-x Provide?
Cocos2d-x doesn't stop with what you have read so far. If you can dream up the game, using Cocos2d-x can help you implement your vision. Cocos2d-x also provides:

    Saving Game Data
    Custom OpenGL
    Physics

and much more!
